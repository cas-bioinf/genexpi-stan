Introduction. Titsias & Honkela

Problems with ODE solver over interpolated data

The integration trick

The model is not well identified:

- approximately linear regulation (tails of sigmoid)
- constant synthesis solution & regulated solution (different starting points)
- positive weight solution vs. negative weight
- hitting one of two peaks

Some identification problems may be resolved by reparametrization

Some by filtering constant synthesis first


How to handle the regulator(s)?

- Splines
- GP - had problems fitting

forcing positivity with log1pexp makes for weird random profiles, rather move closest point to zero. min is a continuous (and mostly smooth) function of the spline coeffs

First refine regulator by working with known targets.

Reducing actual posterior to multivariate normal and using to fit other genes.
